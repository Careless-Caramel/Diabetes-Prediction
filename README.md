# Objective :

The goal of this project is to predict the onset of diabetes based on diagnostic measures.

# Dataset :

https://www.kaggle.com/uciml/pima-indians-diabetes-database

# About Data :

This dataset is originally from the National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases. The objective of the dataset is to diagnostically predict whether or not a patient has diabetes, based on certain diagnostic measurements included in the dataset. Several constraints were placed on the selection of these instances from a larger database. In particular, all patients here are females at least 21 years old of Pima Indian heritage.The datasets consists of several medical predictor variables and one target variable, Outcome. Predictor variables includes the number of pregnancies the patient has had, their BMI, insulin level, age, and so on.

# Implementation : 
Libraries: 
1. sklearn 
2. pandas 

# Classification Report:
The performance of the model is calculated using accuracy_score function.It computes the accuracy, either the fraction (default) or the count (normalize=False) of correct predictions.

I have got 76% accuracy which I think is pretty good ;)
